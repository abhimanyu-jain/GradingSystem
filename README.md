# GradingSystem
Final project for Object-Oriented Development at Boston University

Top-level TODO:

  1. Object design
    * Decide backend classes and their relationships
    * Decide frontend classes and their relationships
    * Produce UML 
  2. Data design
    * Decide what tables will be
    * Design query APIs

Hey, don't have big delete buttons that immediately do things. That would be destructive
Keep track of external libraries and dependencies
Can use Netbeans, etc.

Andy's thoughts on mockup:

  - Login page is good
  - Course selection is good. Might be good to separate classes into groups so that the dropdown menu is not too big. For example, current semester and past semesters
  - Creating courses is nice and easy
  - For statistics, visuals are better than numbers. For example, histograms! Swing might just be not-so-stupid enough to have this
  - Always good to get people to use it, and see how long it takes them to do things
  - List of priorities was good. Focus on those
